    Parameters
    ----------
    project : str, optional
        Name of the project to select or the full path to the project
        or AEDTZ archive to open.  The default is ``None``, in which
        case an attempt is made to get an active project. If no
        projects are present, an empty project is created.
    design : str, optional
        Name of the design to select. The default is ``None``, in
        which case an attempt is made to get an active design. If no
        designs are present, an empty design is created.
    version : str, int, float, optional
        Version of AEDT to use. The default is ``None``. If ``None``,
        the active setup is used or the latest installed version is
        used.
    non_graphical : bool, optional
        Whether to launch AEDT in the non-graphical mode. The default
        is ``False``, in which case AEDT is launched in the graphical mode.
    new_desktop : bool, optional
        Whether to launch an instance of AEDT in a new thread, even if
        another instance of the ``specified_version`` is active on the
        machine.  The default is ``False``.
    close_on_exit : bool, optional
        Whether to release AEDT on exit. The default is ``False``.
    student_version : bool, optional
        Whether to open the AEDT student version. The default is ``False``.
    aedt_process_id : int, optional
        Only used when ``new_desktop = False``, specifies by process ID which instance
        of Electronics Desktop to point PyAEDT at.
    remove_lock : bool, optional
        Whether to remove lock to project before opening it or not.
        The default is ``False``, which means to not unlock
        the existing project if needed and raise an exception.
