"""Enums from the ``EmitApiPython`` module are defined as ``None`` until this module initializes.

This allows IDE auto-complete to find them and ``emit_constants`` to import before the
``EmitApiPython`` module has loaded (typically when a ``ansys.aedt.core.Emit()`` object is created).

Because the members must be reassigned at runtime, the Enum class cannot be used.
